Chapter 2 - Atoms, Molecules, & Life
    A. Atomic & Molecular Structure
    	1. What are Atoms?
	    - Basic unit of matter
	    - Element: Pure form of matter containing only one element
	    	       92 naturally occurring elements
	    - Atoms are composed of smaller subatomic particles, the proteins
	      & neutrons which are found in the nucleus
	    - Electrons orbit the nucleus in what are known as shells, energy levels,
	      or valence levels
	      	First Shell: Max of 2
		   Shell #2: Max of 8
	    - If the outer shell is at its capacity for electrons, it is said to be inert
	    - Elements whose outer shells are not full are said to be reactive
	    - The atomic number is how many protons are in the nucleus of the element
	    - The atomic mass is the number of protons added to the number of neutrons
	    - An isotope of an element has the normal number of protons, but a different number of neutrons
	    	Most carbon as found in nature is 12_C
		One isotope is that 13_C (6 Protons + 7 Neutrons)
	    - Many isotopes are radioactive, and decay over time until they reach a more stable chemical state
	    - A compound is two or more elements combined together to make something new.
	      NaCL (Table Salt) is made from a toxic gas (CL) & Sodium (Na) an explosive metal.
    B. Bonds
    	1. Atoms are held together by bonds to form compounds
	    2. Atoms bond together with other atoms in order to achieve a full outer electron shell
	    3. Covalent bonds form when 2 or more atoms share electrons in their outer shells
	    4. If the e^- is shared roughly equally between the two atoms, it is non-polar, as each end
	    of the molecule doesn't have a charge
	   5. If e^-'s are not shared equally, it becomes polar. Each end of the molecule has a slight
	   +/- charge to it
	6. Ionic
	    - Ionic bonds form when electrons are transferred from one atom to another. Atoms that have
	      gained or lost electrons, altering the balance between protons & electrons.
	    - Na+ -> Cl- :--> NaCl (Salt) Na lends one e^- to the chlorine
	7. Hydrogen Bonds
	    - Is the attraction between the slightly (+) is a polar molecule * the slightly (-) charge
	      of a nearby polar molecule
    C. The importance of water
    	1. Due to its polarity water makes an excellent solvent
	2. Main transport medium, blood & urine are mostly H2O
	3. Water prevents drastic changes in temperature inside the body
	   due to its high heat capacity
    D. The pH Scale
        1. Definitions
	    - Acid: when dissolved in water, gives off hydrogen ions -> H+
	    - Base; when dissolved in water, gives off hydroxyl ions -> OH-
	2. Is a logarithmic system that runs from 0 to 14.
	3. Neutral pH is 7
	4. Above 7 -> Basic
	5. Below 7 -> Acid
	6. Just to the right or left of 7 are the weak "acid" or "bases"
	7. Substances that act as buffers help to minimize changes in pH
	    - Your body uses bicarbonate ions to help maintain the pH of your
	      blood in a very narrow range

Chapter 3 - Biological Molecules
    A. Vocab
    	1. The term organic refers to molecules with a carbon skeleton
	2. Inorganic molecules generally lack a carbon skeleton
	3. Monomers are small molecules that make up larger molecules
	4. Polymers are larger molecules
	5. Monomer -> Polymer
	  (glucose)  (glycogen)
    B. Types of Biomolecules
        1. Carbs are sugars & starches that the body uses for quick energy
	    - One Subunits - monosaccharides
	    - Two Subunits - disacchardies
	    -  2+ Subunits - polysaccharides
	2. Lipids are fats that are very high in calories. Fats from animals
	   are typically saturated (filled with max hydrogens) solid @ room
	   temperature. Unsaturated fats typically come from plant sources
	   liquid at room temperature
	3. Proteins are long chains of amino acids
        4. The nucleic acids of RNA & DNA, which store the body's
	   genetic info & produce the proteins we need
	5. ATP (Adenosine-Triphospahte)is the chemical
	   that provides the body's main source of energy

Chapter 4 - Cell Structure and Function

Vocab
    Cyto = Cell
    Pathogen = Disease causing organism

1. Cell Types
    A. Two Basic Cell Types
        1. The cells of a prokaryotic organisms (prokaryotes) are the simplest types of cells,
           they don't have a nucleus to hold their DNA, and don't have any type of complex inner structures, called organelles.
	   Bacteria are among the simplest of organisms and have a prokaryotic cell.
        2. The cells of eukaryotic organisms (eukaryotes) are more complex. These cells have a nucleus that holds the DNA,
           as well as having numerous parts inside the cell to carry out various functions (organelles).
           All plants and animals have these more complex eukaryotic cells.
    B. Animal vs. Plants Cells
	1. Animal cells are generally round in shape and have an outer cell membrane to hold the cell together.
	2. Plant cells are generally square in shape and, in addition to the cell membrane, have a rigid cell wall to give the cell shape and strength.
	   Also, the plant cells have chloroplasts, the organelle that allows them to photosynthesize.

2. Cell Function
    A. Cell Theory
	1. Every living thing is made of cells, which are the smallest units of life. All cells come from preexisting cells.
	2. Cells are small due to the limits of diffusion. If cells were too large, all of the chemicals that must move in and out of the cell couldn't do so fast enough.
    B. Organelles
	1. Organelles are intracellular structures and carry out specific functions.
	2. The cytoplasm is a jelly-like liquid that holds the organelles. {cyto = cell}
	3. The nucleus contains the cell's DNA. It is surrounded by a nuclear membrane.
	4. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis in the cell.
	5. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) looks like a thin, folded ribbon that connects the nucleus to the plasma membrane. Its functions include making molecules that are used to construct
	   other organelles and separating newly made molecules into those that stay in the cell and those that don't.
	   There are 2 types.
		Rough ER is studded with ribosomes, while smooth ER is not.
		The smooth ER makes fatty acids and steroids and also functions to detoxify harmful substances in the liver.
	6. The Golgi complex looks like a stack of flattened sacs. Its function is to process and package proteins that have been made in the cell.
	7. Mitochondria are where ATP synthesis occurs. They are sometimes called the powerhouse of the cell.
	8. Lysosomes(little stomachs) are the sites of intracellular digestion, helping to digest worn-out cell parts and pathogens.
    C. The Cytoskeleton
	1. The cytoskeleton gives the cell shape, and in some cases allows for movement.
	2. The cytoskeleton is made of micro-filaments, intermediate filaments, and micro-tubules.

Chapter 5 - Call Membrane Structure & Function

1. Plasma Membrane
    A. Structure & Function
	1. The plasma membrane is made of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Cholesterol is one of the components.
	2. The membrane is made of 2 layers; this is why the structure is often referred to as a phospholipid bilayer.
	3. The phospholipid molecules that make up the membrane have 2 parts: a hydrophilic (water-loving) head that faces
	   the watery environment of the inside and outside of the cell, and a hydrophobic (water-hating) tail that faces inward.
	4. The membrane is selectively permeable. This means that is is able to let in good substances, such as nutrients and oxygen.
	   And keep out bad substances, such as wastes and toxins.
	5. The membrane also functions in communication between cells using gap junctions, can help to hold cells together via junctions called desmosomes.
	   And make cells leak-proof using tight junctions.
    B. Membrane Proteins
	1. There are a variety of proteins in the membrane. They may be either integral (completely within the membrane itself) or peripheral (stuck to the outside).
	2. Membrane proteins function to help move chemicals back and forth through the membrane. They also function as receptors for chemicals that bind to the membrane
	   or as enzymes that help to speed up chemical reactions.

2. Types of Cellular Transport
    A. Diffusion
	1. Diffusion is the movement of particles down a concentration gradient, from where there are more of them to where there are less of them, until equilibrium is reached.
	2. Diffusion is what happens when you take the lid off a bottle of something and the smell diffuses through the area.
	3. Diffusion just happens; no input of energy is required.
	4. Facilitated diffusion occurs when a protein molecule helps the diffusion process along.
    B. Osmosis
	1. Osmosis is the diffusion of water down a concentration gradient until equilibrium is reached.
	   It also just happens; no energy input is required.
	2. There are 3 possible osmotic conditions.
	   A) An isomotic condition occurs when there is no net movement of water.
	      A cell placed in an isomotic solution will stay the same shape and size. This means that the concentration
	      of particles in the solution is the same as the concentration of particles inside the cell.
	   B) A hypertonic condition occurs when there are more particles outside the cell than inside the cell.
	      This causes water to leave the cell, causing it to shrink.
	   C) A hypotonic condition occurs when there are more particles inside the cell, that there are in the solution.
	      This causes water to rush into the cell, swelling (or even bursting) it.
    C. Energy Requiring Transports
	1. Some processes require the input of energy in order to occur.
	2. Active transport moves particles against their concentration gradient (uphill).
	3. Endocytosis is the movement of substances into a cell (like nutrients).
	4. Exocytosis is the movement of substances out of a cell (like wastes).

Chapter 6 - Energy Flow in the Life of a Cell

1. Energy
    A. Definitions
	1. Energy is the capacity to do work
	2. "Work" may be making molecules, generating motion or generating heat.
	3. Potential energy is stored energy, like the stored energy of water behind a dam
	   or the stored electricity in a battery.
	4. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, like water flowing over a dam.
    B. The Laws of Thermodynamics
	1. The First Law says that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
	2. The Second Law says that whenever energy is concerted from one form to another, the amount of useful energy decreases.
	   The "wasted" energy is usually given off as heat. Internal combustion engines are generally not very efficient, only
	   converting about 20% of the energy in fuel to moving the vehicle; the rest of the energy is wasted as heat.
	3. Living systems are generally more efficient; the human body converts about 38% of the energy in food we eat into useful activities;
	   the rest is given off as heat.
    C. Entropy
	1. Processes that proceed spontaneously lead to increasing disorder. Does this conflict with the general idea of evolution
	   that has simple organisms organizing into more complex organisms?
	2. Energy must be put in to reverse entropy. A box of random parts will not organize itself into something more complex without the input
	   of energy.

2. Energy and Chemical Reactions
    A. Definitions
	1. A chemical reaction is the conversion of one set of chemicals to another.
	2. The reactants are the beginning chemicals, and the products are the ending chemicals.
	3. Endergonic reactions require the input of energy in order to occur.
	   Example:
		ADP + P + energy == ATP
	4. Exergonic reactions release energy.
	   Example:
		ATP breaks down to ADP + P + energy
	5. Activation energy is the initial push of energy required to get a reaction going.
	6. Coupled reactions are when an exergonic reaction provides the energy to drive an endergonic reaction.
	   This situation occurs in photosynthesis -- the sun's energy drives sugar-making reactions in plants.

3. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)
    A. Energy Carrier Molecules (ECM)
	1. ATP is the most common ECM
	2. ATP is made of adenosine, a sugar called ribose, and 3 phosphate molecules
	3. The energy to make ATP comes from glucose.
	4. The breaking of the phosphate bond releases energy.
    B. Electron Carriers (EC)
	1. There are other molecules that transport energy within a cell.
	2. These molecules, like NAD+ and FAD, donate their electrons and the energy in them to drive endergonic reactions.

4. Metabolic Reactions
    A. Definitions
	1. Metabolism is the sum of all the different chemical reactions taking place in an organism.
	2. Homeostatis is the maintaining of a steady state in an organism. Some parameters that must be maintained in
	   equilibrium are blood pressure, heart rate, water balance, pH, body temperature, and glucose levels. These are
	   all monitored and controlled by the brain. Corrective action is taken to keep factors in their correct ranges.
	   For example, if your blood pressure becomes too thick because you are becoming dehydrated, your brain senses this
	   and gives you the sensation of thirst, which drives you to drink water to rehydrate yourself and return your blood
	   to the normal level of hydration.
    B. Enzymes
	1. Enzymes are specialized protein molecules that catalyze (speed up) chemical reactions.
	2. The molecules they affect are called substrates.
	3. They speed up reactions without being destroyed or forming byproducts.
	4. There are more than 2,000 known enzymes.
	5. An enzyme's functionality depends on its shape. If this shape is changed by extremes
	   of temperature or pH, it may be damaged or destroyed. This is called denaturation.
	   Most enzymes have a three dimensional shape; if this shape is damaged, the enzyme will not
	   function, just as a bent key will no longer fit in the lock.
	6. Most biological reactions occur best at normal body temperature and pH levels.

Chapter 7 - Photosynthesis

1. Photosynthesis
    A. The Reaction
	1. Photosynthesis is the conversion of the sun's energy into chemical energy by plants.
	   (A few other organisms can also photosynthesize, like some bacteria).
	2. The reactants are carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) and the products are
	   glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). Notice that carbon dioxide is a critical input to
	   the reaction.
	   Example:
		6(CO2)+6(H2O) -> C6H12O6 + 6(O2)
    B. The Location
	1. Photosynthesis takes place in leaves (or other green parts, like stems). Leaves are
	   generally thin and easily penetrated by light. Plant that aren't green still have chlorophyll
	   and photosynthesize; they have other pigments that mask the presence of the green chlorophyll.
	2. Plants have a large surface area for photosynthesis.
	3. Plants have pores in their leave call stomata that open and close to let O2 and CO2 in and out,
	   as well as to let water out. In land plants, the stomata tend to be concentrated on the lower
	   surface of the leaf; this helps to reduce water loss. In water plants, the stomata are found
	   all over the left, since water loss isn't a concern.
	4. Photosynthesis happens in organelles called chloroplasts, which contain the green pigment chlorophyll.
	5. The semi-fluid substance inside leaves is called stroma, and it holds structures called thylakoids that look
	   like disc-shaped flatted sacs. It's in these thylakoids that light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur.
    C. Light and Dark Reactions
	1. The light-dependent reactions capture sunlight and convert it into ATP and a molecule called NADPH.
	   These reactions consume water and release O2. These reactions take place in the thylakoids in locations
	   called photosystems. Each of the photosystems contains proteins, chlorophyll and other pigments.
	2. The light-independent (dark) reactions use the ATP and NADPH to make glucose, using CO2 in the process.
	   The chemicals from these reactions are cycled back into the light reactions; since the process occurs in a cycle,
	   it's called the C3 or Calvin Cycle.

2. Water Conservation and Photosynthesis
    A. Carbon Dioxide
	1. CO2 is the required input for photosynthesis
	2. If the water supply to the plant is inadequate, the stomata leaves stay open, letting in CO2. This "normal"
	   pathway to photosynthesize is called the C3 pathway.
	3. If the plant is dry, the stomata close to save water. This prevents CO2 from entering, which slows or stops photosynthesis.
	4. This triggers a process called photorespiration, which is a wasteful process that prevents the Calvin Cycle
	   from producing glucose, essentially shutting down photosynthesis.
    B. Alternate Pathways
	1. Some plants have developed alternate pathways to reduce photosrespiration, allowing them to
	   produce glucose even during hot, dry conditions.
	2. The two pathways are:
		A) Some plants, called C4 plants, use a separate series of reactions to capture carbon in one part of the leaf
	 	   and move it to another part of the leaf where it can enter the Calvin Cycle. Crabgrass, corn and sugarcane
		   are examples of C4 plants.
		B) Some plants, go a step further and in addition to using this C4 pathway also keep their stomata closed
		   during the day to conserve water, this is called CAM. The cacti are CAM plants.

Chapter 8 - Harvesting Energy: Glycolysis & Cellular Respiration

1. Cellular Respiration
    A. Energy and Cell Work
	1. Cells need energy to make and transport molecules, grow, repair, and divide.
	2. Energy is stored in the bonds of molecules like fats & carbohydrates.
	   The energy in these bonds must be transferred to the bonds of energy carrier molecules
	   like ATP.
	3. Cells break down glucose for energy. Brain cells can only use glucose for energy--nothing else!
	4. Photosynthesis is the ultimate source of energy. All organisms ultimately rely on plants.
	5. Photosynthesis and glucose metabolism are complementary processes.
		6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2 is Photosynthesis
		C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy is Cellular Respiration
    B. The Steps of Glucose Metabolism
	1. Glycolysis
		A) Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell
		B) One molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate
		C) The process doesn't need oxygen to proceed (it is anaerobic)
		D) There is a net production of two molecules of ATP per glucose
	2. The Citric Acid (Krebs) Cycle
		A) The process requires oxygen (is aerobic)
		B) The process occurs in the mitochondria
		C) In a series of steps, the pyruvate from glycolysis is broken down
		   to CO2 and H2O.
		D) There is a net production of 2 molecules of ATP.
		E) The electron carrier molecules NADH and FADH2 are also produced.
	3. The Electron Transport Chain
		A) This process occurs in the mitochondria.
		B) This process is also aerobic
		C) The process occurs in a series of steps that take electrons from NADH and
		   FADH2 and move them down a "chain" of molecules until they ultimately reach
  		   O2, which is the final electron acceptor. This is why we must have a
		   constant supply of O2; without it, this process stops immediately.
		D) Most of the cell's energy is produced during this process; up to 34
		   molecules of ATP per glucose molecule.

2. Fermentation
    A. Fermentation is Anaerobic
	1. Fermentation provides a mechanism for organisms(like some bacteria) to live in
	   environments with no oxygen.
	2. These types of environments are often found beneath bodies of water like lakes
	   and oceans and in marshes, swamps, and bogs.
    B. Mechanisms of Action
	1. Fermentation only involves Glycolysis, no Krebs cycle or ETC can occur.
	2. The pyruvate produced by glycolysis acts as an electron acceptor for NADH.
	   The pyruvate is converted to either ethanol or lactate (depending on the organism
	   that is undergoing fermentation).
	3. The NADH is converted back to a molecule called NAD+, which keeps the glycolysis
	   and ATP production going.
    C. Ethanol or Lactate Production
	1. Alcoholic fermentation by yeasts produces ethanol and CO2 as byproducts. This
	   type of fermentation by yeasts produces the beer and wine, as well as bread products.
	   The CO2 produces the bubbles in beer and Champagne. In bread products, the CO2 produced
	   by yeast causes the bread to rise. The alcohol evaporates away during the cooking process
	   The spaces left behind in the bread represent where the carbon dioxide bubbles were.
	2. Some organisms, like bacteria, produce lactate as they are undergoing fermentation.
	   This process produces foods like sauerkraut, dill pickles, cheeses, and yogurt.
	   Different species of bacteria produce the different flavors of cheeses.
	3. Prior to refrigeration, these processes allowed food to be preserved for long
	   period of time. Prior to modern sanitation, alcoholic beverages were often the
	   only safe fluid to drink, as the water was often contaminated with pathogens.

Chapter 9 - The continuity of Life: Cellular Respiration

1. Cell Division Basics
    A. Why do cells divide?
	1. Cells reproduce by cell division, which gives rise to 2 daughter cells
	   which are identical to the original cell
	2. Each cell contains the genetic information, found on one or more chromosomes.
 	3. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the material that holds the genetic info.
	   DNA is composed of repeating units, called nucleotides, which are made up of sugar
	   called deoxyribose, phosphate groups and one of four bases. The four bases are
	   adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine.
	4. The units of inheritance are called genes, which are sections of DNA
    B. Two Types of Reproduction
	1. Simple organisms, like bacteria, simply split in two in order to reproduce. This
	   process is called binary fission and makes up what is known as the prokaryotic cell cycle.
  	   Organisms produced by this method are generally all clones of each other, with no genetic diversity.
	2. Most organisms, like humans, utilize the more complex process of sexual reproduction, which produces
	   gametes (eggs and sperm). This process produces individuals that are genetically unique from each other,
	   and is called the eukaryotic cell cycle.

2. The Eukaryotic Cell Cycle
    A. Organization of Chromosomes
	1. DNA is found in the nucleus of eukaryotic organisms.
	2. Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). One of each pair
	   comes from each parent. The chromosomes are numbered 1-23
	   and each pair are called homologous chromosomes (one of each pair comes from each parent)
	3. Cells that have all 23 pairs, which are all cells except gametes, are called diploids, also written as 2n.
	   Gamete cells have half the number of chromosomes are called haploid, also written as n.
	4. The chromosomes themselves are made up of two chromatids, which are held together in the
	   center by a structure called a centromere.
   B. Steps of the Eukaryotic Cell Cycle
	1. The eukaryotic cell cycle is divided into two major phases; interphase and cell division.
	2. During interphase, the cell acquires nutrients from the environment, grows and duplicates
	   its chromosomes. Interphase is divided into three sections.
		A) During G1, cells grow and differentiate (turn into whatever kind of cell they are going to become)
		B) During S, the cell duplicates its chromosomes.
		C) During G2, cell growth continues and the cell prepares to divide.
	3. After all these steps are completed, which take about a day in human cells, the cell prepares to divide its nucleus
	   in a process called mitosis.
    C. Mitosis
	1. Mitosis is a series of steps, divides the nucleus, and as a result produces cells that are 
	   identical to the original cell. As an example, if your skin is damaged and must be repaired
	   your body will produce new identical cells through the process of mitosis.
	2. Mitosis is divided into several phases.
		A) During prophase, the duplicated chromosomes condense from what is called chromatin.
		   Chromatin is what the genetic material is called before mitosis occurs. It just appears
	  	   as a mass of thready material. Also during this phase the spindle microtubules appear.
		   These are structures that will literally help pull apart the chromosomes.
		B) During metaphase, each chromosomes lines up along the equator of the cell.
		C) During anaphase, the centromere holding each chromosome dissolves, allowing
		   sister chromatids to separate and move toward opposite sides of the cell.
		D) During telophase, when the chromatids reach the sides of the cell, the spindle
		   microtubules disintegrate and a nuclear envelope forms around the chromosomes.
		- A Mnemonic for this process is called
			Pizza Makes A Triangle
	3. The summary of mitosis is that starting with one original cell, two identical daughter
	   cells are produced. These cells are genetically identical to the starting cell and
	   to each other, and are diploid(2n).
    D. Meiosis
	1. The key to sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is meiosis, the production of haploid cells
	   with unpaired chromosomes from diploid parent cells with paired chromosomes.
	2. If it wasn't for meiosis, the number of chromosomes in the nuclei of each subsequent
	   generation would double. That is, each time a sperm and egg united at fertilization
	   the number of chromosomes would double. Meiosis prevents this by producing gametes that
	   are haploid, so that upon fertilization a new individual that is diploid is produced. 
	3. Meiosis has some steps in common with mitosis, and some that are different. Meiosis is
	   accomplished in two rounds of cell division. They have the same names as the steps in
	   mitosis, but are distinguished by the Roman numerals I and II.
	4. The steps of meiosis are:
		A) During prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair off with each other, rather
		   than separating. During this crucial step, the homologous pairs randomly exchange
		   genetic information with each other in a process called crossing over. It's this
		   process that helps to create the genetic diversity among individuals that makes us
		   all unique from each other.
		B) During metaphase I, the chromosome pairs line up at the equator of the cell, just
		   like during mitosis.
		C) During anaphase I, one member of each pair of chromosomes moves to the opposite side
		   of the cell (note that the centromere does not dissolve)
		D) During telophase I, the cell splits in two, just like it does in mitosis. 
		   (A.K.A cytokinesis)
		E) The steps of meiosis II are basically the same as they are during mitosis.
		   During metaphase II the chromosomes line up at the equator.
		   During anaphase II the centromeres dissolve and one of each of the chromatids goes
		   to each side of the cell.
		   During telophase II and cytokinesis, the cell splits in two.
		F) The net result of meiosis is that from an original, diploid cell, four haploid cells
		   are produced.

Chapter 10 - Patterns of Inheritance

1. Vocab
    A. Inheritance: is the passing along of hereditary traits from one generation to the next
    B. Genetics: is the study of inheritance
    C. The genotype: is an organism's genetic makeup
    D. The phenotype: is an organism's physical appearance. It is possible that two organisms
       can appear the same (same phenotype) but have different genotypes.
    E. Alleles: are alternative forms of a gene that code for the same trait. Alleles can also
       be known as variants. As an example, the alleles for hair color in humans are brown, black,
       red, blond, etc.
    F. A mutation: is a permanent change in an allele that produces a variant of the same trait.
    G. A dominant allele: is one that dominates or masks the presence of another allele. In other
       words, it is the trait seen most often in a population. For example, the dominant alleles
       for hair and eye color in humans are brown. Dominant alleles are always represented by
       capital letters when writing them in genetic shorthand. For example, if tallness was a
       dominant allele, it would be written as a "T"
    H. A recessive allele is one that is masked by another allele; in other words, the variant of a trait
       that is seen least often in a population. A recessive allele for eye color in humans is blue. In
       genetic shorthand, recessive alleles are represented by the lower case letter of dominant trait.
       In the example above for tallness (T), shortness would be represented by "t".
    I. An individual who is homozygous for a trait has inherited the same gene for that trait on each
       homologous chromosome. In other words, that individual has gotten the same allele for a trait
       from each parent. As an example, if an individual has inherited the dominant trait for tallness
       from each parent, that individual would be called homozygous dominant for that trait, and the
       genetic shorthand would be written as "TT". These individuals are known as true breeders, since
       they aren't hiding any recessive genes. Note that an individual could also be homozygous recessive,
       having gotten a copy of the recessive gene from each parent. This individual would be written as "tt".
    J. If an individual has inherited a different copy of the gene from each parent, they are called
       heterozygous. The shorthand would be written as "Tt". Note that this individual would still be tall
       because the tallness is dominant and hides the other copy of the recessive gene. These individuals
       are called carries, since they are "carrying" on copy of the recessive gene.
    K. Incomplete dominance is when neither member of a pair of alleles dominates over the other and
       the heterozygote is a mixture of the two traits. AS an example, snapdragon flowers can be either
       red or white when they are homozygous. The heterozygote produces pink flowers.
		
		RR (red flowers) crossed with rr (white flowers) = Rr (pink flowers)

    L. The sex chromosomes (X & Y) are responsible for the transmission of several non-sexual traits.
       One of these is red-green color blindness, which is passed along on the X chromosome from the mother.
       These conditions are called sex-linked traits.
    M. Co-dominance occurs when both alleles of a pair are fully expressed in the heterozygote. An example
       of this is the ABO blood typing system. There are people with Type A blood (Type A proteins on their
       blood cells), people with Type B blood (Type B proteins) and people with Type AB blood (both A & B proteins).
       Type O blood has neither A nor B proteins.
    N. The independent inheritance of two or more traits is called the law of independent assortment.
       This means that genes for different traits, like those that determine seed color and shape in 
       plants, can be inherited independently of each other and not influence each other during the
       formation of gametes.

2. Punnett Squares
    1. Punnett squares are a method to determine the statistical outcomes of various traits when two
       individuals are bred together.
    2. A monohybrid cross utilizes a four-square grid to examine the outcomes of one trait at a time.
    3. A dihybrid cross utilizes a 16-square grid to examine the outcomes of two traits at a time.

3. Genetic Disorders
    1. Turner syndrome affects 1 in 3,000 females, who have only one X chromosome
       and are infertile.  
    2. Trisomy affects 1 in 5,000 females, who have 3X chromosomes, are usually fertile
       but may have below average intelligence.
    3. Klinefelter syndrome affects 1 in 1,000 males, who have an extra X chromosome
       (XXY). These individuals are usually infertile and may have mixed sexual characteristics.
    4. Jacob syndrome affects 1 in 1,000 males who have an extra Y chromosome (XYY). These individuals
       have elevated testosterone, severe acne, are tall and have decreased intelligence and increased
       aggresiveness.
    5. Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) individuals have an extra copy of chromosome 21. These individuals
       have varying levels of developmental disability, from mild to severe. It occurs in about 1 out
       of 700 births, with greatly increased risk for mothers over 40 yeards old.
       (women--how old are your eggs?)

Chapter 11 - DNA: The Molecule of Heredity

1. DNA Structure
    A. DNA's Structure and Components
	1. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) forms the inherited material inside each cell.
	   Each cell contains the information required to reproduce itself.
	2. Genes, which are the units of inherited traits, are made of segments of DNA.
	   Humans have about 20,000 genes to code for all of the characteristics required to
	   make a human a human These genes contain about 3 billion base pairs (AT, CG).
	   It is the specific order of these base pairs that produces our human traits. The
	   discovery of this information was the result of the Human Genome Project, a lengthy
	   expensive process that was the result of a multi-national effort completed in 2003.
	   You can now have your genes sequenced for about $1,000 or so (a company called
	   23 and me provides this service). The speed and relative cheapness of this was unheard
	   of a few years ago. People use this to determine whether they carry genes for diseases
	   like cancer, for example.
	3. Genes control protein synthesis. Genes contain the "recipes"; that is, the instructions
	   to produce the proteins required for us to live.
	4. The structure of DNA was discovered in the 1950's by two men -- James Watson and
	   Francis Crick. They received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
		A) DNA is a chain of repeating units called nucleotides.
		B) Each nucleotide consists of three parts:
		    1) A compound called a base. There are 4 bases in total:
			Adenine  (A)
			Thymine  (T)
			Cytosine (C)
			Guanine  (G)
		    2) A sugar called deoxyribose
		    3) A phosphate group (PO4-)
		C) The DNA molecule looks like a twisted ladder, and is called a double helix.
		   The sugar and phosphate molecules form the sides (rails) of the ladder. While
		   the bases form the steps (rungs).
		D) Each rung is made of 2 bases bonded together. They are pair together in a certain
		   way: A with T and C with G; never any other way.
	5. DNA is like a language and A,T,C & G, are the letters. It is merely the order of the letters
	   that determines the genes. Nothing else varies -- the deoxyribose sugar and the phospahte groups
	   are always the same. The order of the letters determine each gene, and each person's genes have
	   a uniqueness to them that makes us each different (unless you have an identical twin). Note however
	   that the amount of genetic variability from one person to the next is only a few percent -- that's
	   all it takes to make us each unique.

    B. DNA Replication (copying)
	1. Before cells can divide, the cell must make an exact copy of the DNA, so that each new
	   cell can be identical to the original one.
	2. The ingredients involved are the original (parental) DNA strands and the bases (A,T,C & G)
	3. Several enzymes direct the process. DNA helicases break apart the DNA molecule by "unzipping"
	   the weak hydrogen bonds between each base in the DNA rungs. DNA polymerases move along each
	   strand of parental DNA, matching un-complementary bases to the bases of the parental strand.
	   Once finished, DNA ligases reattach everything back together again.
	4. This process is called semi-conservative, since each new DNA molecule is made of one original
	   strand and one newly created strand.

2. Mutations
    A. Definitions
	1. Mutations are changes in the base sequence of DNA. Mutations may be harmful; if they are really
	   damaging a cell or organism inheriting such a mutation may quickly die. Some mutations have no
	   effect; in rare instances they may be beneficial.
	2. They may occur as a result of mistakes during DNA replication, or from environmental factors
	   like chemicals or radiation.
	3. Even with all this, errors in DNA are quite rate, with completed DNA strands having only one
	   mistake per 100 million to one billion base pairs. There are DNA repair enzymes that "proofread"
	   each daughter strand both during and after synthesis and repair any mistakes found. 

    B. Types of Mutations
	1. Base substitution occurs when incorrect bases are incorporated into the growing
 	   DNA double helix.
	2. Insertion mutations occur when one or more extra bases are inserted when DNA is replicating.
	3. Deletion mutations occur when one or more bases are deleted when DNA is replicating.
    
    C. Effects
	1. Deletions or insertions may have catastrophic effects due to the fact that all genetic
	   information that follows downstream from the mutation will be affected.
	2. As an example, consider the following string literal "The Dog Saw The Cat"
	    	Deleting every 'E' and reshuffling the remaining letters produces gibberish:
				THD OGS AWT HCA T
	3. Base substitutions may or may not have an effect. Most of the amino acids can be
	   produced by several combination of bases, so an occasional error may end up producing
	   the desired amino acid anyway. For example, there are five possible combinations of
	   bases that will produce the amino acid leucine. Most of the 20 amino acids have this
	   type of redundancy so that mistakes are less likely to result in the amino acid not
	   being reproduced.

Chapter 12 - Gene Expression & Regulation

1. RNA: The Other Nucleic Acid
    A. RNA Info
	1. Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) is a single-stranded molecule
	2. RNA substitutes the base uracil for thymine (it pairs with adenine)
	3. RNA uses sugar ribose (rather than deoxyribose)
	4. There are 3 types of RNA
	    a) Messenger RNA (mRNA) directs the synthesis of proteins
	    b) Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) makes up the ribosomes, which are sites of protein synthesis
	    c) Transfer RNA  (tRNA) bring individual amino acids to the ribosomes and hold them
	       in place while they are built into the growing protein.

2. The Genetic Code, Transcription, Translation & Gene Expression
    A. The Genetic Code
	1. The genetic code is the "dictionary" that is used to make proteins from the 20 different amino
	   acids. It translates the sequence of bases in DNA and RNA into the sequence of amino acids in
	   proteins.
	2. Each amino acid is coded for by a sequence of three bases. These three-base are called triplets
	   or codons.
	3. Some amino acids are coded for by only one codon; most of them have multiple codons that produce
	   the same amino acid.
	4. All proteins being with the amino acid methionine, which is called the start codon.
	5. Three codons serve as stop codons; when these codons are reached, the protein is doing being made.
	
    B. Transcription
	1. Transcription is the process of copying DNA, which occurs in the nucleus.
	2. DNA server as the template to make mRNA. Each sequence of 3 bases of DNA is transcribed into
	   a complementary 3 base codon, following the base pairing rules. For example, the series CCG on
	   the DNA would be translated into the mRNA codon GGC.
	3. When your body needs to make more of a certain protein, enzymes find the correct gene in the DNA
	   where the instructions are located. The enzymes unzip the area of the DNA to be copied and travel along
	  it from start to finish, making codons from each 3 base sequence.
	4. When the mRNA sequence is done, it detaches from the DNA and enzymes close the DNA back up.
    
    C. Translation
	1. Translation is the process that takes the mRNA that was copied from DNA and uses it to make a protein.
	   This process occurs in the cytoplasm, on the ribosomes. 
	2. There are free amino acids floating around in the cytoplasm, each attached to a tRNA molecule.
	3. Beginning with a start codon and ending with a stop codon, the tRNA molecules bring amino acids,
	   one at a time, in the correct order, to build the protein on the ribosome.
	4. Each tRNA molecule has 2 things attached to it. On one end is an amino acid; on the other end
	   is an anti-codon, which is a complement of a codon.	
	5. For example, the codon AA on mRNA would be paired up with the anti-codon UUU on a tRNA molecule.
	6. This process occurs over and over, very rapidly, until the protein is completed. The average
	   protein only takes a few seconds to be made. It then detaches from the ribosome and is ready
	   to be used wherever it is needed.

    D. Gene Expression
	1. Gene expression is the transcription and translation of a gene.
	2. Human cells contain all 20,000 genes of the human genome, but most cells express only
	   a small number of them.
	3. The genes expressed depend of the type of cell. For example, males have the gene for
	   casein, which is a milk protein, but never express it.
	4. The environment can have an effect of gene expression. Birds only express the genes for
	   mating and nesting behavior during warm weather, when their offspring have the best chance
	   for survival. 

Chapter 14 - Principles of Evolution

1. The Fossil Record
     A. The Nature of Fossils
	1. A fossil is a trace of a long-dead organism
	2. Fossils are often found in sedimentary rock, which is formed when sediment is laid
	   down by wind or water.
	3. Fossils usually develop from the hard parts of organisms, such as bones and teeth. Soft
	   parts usually decay or are eaten before they can fossilize.
    
    B. Distribution of Fossils
	1. The lowest layers of sedimentary rock are assumed to be the oldest; this is called relative
	   age.
	2. Fossils show that many organisms that once existed are now extinct.
	3. Fossils show that some species are living where similar ones that existed in the past
	   are now extinct, like modern-day kangaroos and armadillos.

2. Charles Darwin & His Theories
    A. History of Darwin
	1. He was born in England in 1809
	2. He sailed around the South Pacific for 5 years as the science officer on the ship
	   HMS Beagle. He collected huge amounts of data and samples from his travels.
	3. Upon returning, he published his famous work "On the Origin of Species" after
	   more than 25 years of thinking and writing.

    B. His Theories
	1. The theory of Descent with Modification states that the newer life forms appearing
	   in the fossil record are descendants of older species, and that all species have
	   descended from a few types of life.
	2. The theory of natural selection, also sometimes called survival of the fittest,
	   states that some individuals develop traits that help them to cope better with the
	   environment, and that organisms with more favorable traits will be able to reproduce
	   more. A population adapts to the environment as favorable traits increase.

3. Evidence of Evolution
    A. Homologous and Analogous Structures
	1. Homologous structures have the same evolutionary origin, despite current differences
	   in function or appearance. For example, the forelimbs of penguins, alligators, humans
	   and bates all have the same skeletal structure, even though they perform different functions.
	2. Analogous structures perform the same function, and may look similar, but are very different
	   in internal anatomy. For example, the wings of moths and birds are analogous (allow for flight),
	   but are made of very different structures.
    
    B. Vestigal Structures
	1. Vestigal structures were of some use to an ancestor, but are of no known current use now.
	2. Vestigal structures may provide clues as to the origin of a modern species. For example,
	   did the whales evolve from a land species?
	3. Example of vestigal structures in humans include the tail bone, wisdom teeth, and appendix.
	   Examples for other animals include pelvic bones in whales and some snakes and the dew claws
	   in dogs.

    C. Similarities in Embryology
	1. The early stages of vertebrate embryos are very similar to each other.
	2. These similarities fade as development proceeds.

    D. Similarities in Macromolecules
	1. Many species share molecules that are very similar.
	2. Many species use hemoglobin to carry oxygen in the blood. Human and gorilla
	   hemoglobin differs by only one amino acid.

4. Patterns of Evolution
    A. Co-evolution
	1. Co-evolution is the change in two or more species in close association with each
	   other over time.
	2. Example are the relationships between predators and prey, parasites and hosts
	   and plants and pollinators. For example, the Ophrys orchid resembles a female bee.
	   The male bee attempts to mate with it, pollinating the flower in the process.
    
    B. Convergent Evolution
	1. This is when organisms that appear to be closely related are not. This occurs when
	   the environment selects for a particular phenotype. An example is the shark (a fish)
	   and the dolphin (a mammal).

    C. Divergent Evolution
	1. This occurs when two or more species become dissimilar over time. This usually occurs
	   in response to a group of the animals moving to a different habitat, like a flock of birds
	   being blown to a new area.
	2. May result in the formation of a new species.
