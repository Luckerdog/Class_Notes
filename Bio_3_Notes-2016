Chapter 2 - Atoms, Molecules, & Life
    A. Atomic & Molecular Structure
    	1. What are Atoms?
	    - Basic unit of matter
	    - Element: Pure form of matter containing only one element
	    	       92 naturally occurring elements
	    - Atoms are composed of smaller subatomic particles, the proteins
	      & neutrons which are found in the nucleus
	    - Electrons orbit the nucleus in what are known as shells, energy levels,
	      or valence levels
	      	First Shell: Max of 2
		   Shell #2: Max of 8
	    - If the outer shell is at its capacity for electrons, it is said to be inert
	    - Elements whose outer shells are not full are said to be reactive
	    - The atomic number is how many protons are in the nucleus of the element
	    - The atomic mass is the number of protons added to the number of neutrons
	    - An isotope of an element has the normal number of protons, but a different number of neutrons
	    	Most carbon as found in nature is 12_C
		One isotope is that 13_C (6 Protons + 7 Neutrons)
	    - Many isotopes are radioactive, and decay over time until they reach a more stable chemical state
	    - A compound is two or more elements combined together to make something new.
	      NaCL (Table Salt) is made from a toxic gas (CL) & Sodium (Na) an explosive metal.
    B. Bonds
    	1. Atoms are held together by bonds to form compounds
	2. Atoms bond together with other atoms in order to achieve a full outer electron shell
	3. Covalent bonds form when 2 or more atoms share electrons in their outer shells
	4. If the e^- is shared roughly equally between the two atoms, it is non-polar, as each end
	   of the molecule doesn't have a charge
	5. If e^-'s are not shared equally, it becomes polar. Each end of the molecule has a slight
	   +/- charge to it
	6. Ionic
	    - Ionic bonds form when electrons are transferred from one atom to another. Atoms that have
	      gained or lost electrons, altering the balance between protons & electrons.
	    - Na+ -> Cl- :--> NaCl (Salt) Na lends one e^- to the chlorine
	7. Hydrogen Bonds
	    - Is the attraction between the slightly (+) is a polar molecule * the slightly (-) charge
	      of a nearby polar molecule
    C. The importance of water
    	1. Due to its polarity water makes an excellent solvent
	2. Main transport medium, blood & urine are mostly H2O
	3. Water prevents drastic changes in temperature inside the body
	   due to its high heat capacity
    D. The pH Scale
        1. Definitions
	    - Acid: when dissolved in water, gives off hydrogen ions -> H+
	    - Base; when dissolved in water, gives off hydroxyl ions -> OH-
	2. Is a logarithmic system that runs from 0 to 14.
	3. Neutral pH is 7
	4. Above 7 -> Basic
	5. Below 7 -> Acid
	6. Just to the right or left of 7 are the weak "acid" or "bases"
	7. Substances that act as buffers help to minimize changes in pH
	    - Your body uses bicarbonate ions to help maintain the pH of your
	      blood in a very narrow range

Chapter 3 - Biological Molecules
    A. Vocab
    	1. The term organic refers to molecules with a carbon skeleton
	2. Inorganic molecules generally lack a carbon skeleton
	3. Monomers are small molecules that make up larger molecules
	4. Polymers are larger molecules
	5. Monomer -> Polymer
	  (glucose)  (glycogen)
    B. Types of Biomolecules
        1. Carbs are sugars & starches that the body uses for quick energy
	    - One Subunits - monosaccharides
	    - Two Subunits - disacchardies
	    -  2+ Subunits - polysaccharides
	2. Lipids are fats that are very high in calories. Fats from animals
	   are typically saturated (filled with max hydrogens) solid @ room
	   temperature. Unsaturated fats typically come from plant sources
	   liquid at room temperature
	3. Proteins are long chains of amino acids
        4. The nucleic acids of RNA & DNA, which store the body's
	   genetic info & produce the proteins we need
	5. ATP (Adenosine-Triphospahte)is the chemical
	   that provides the body's main source of energy

Chapter 4 - Cell Structure and Function

Vocab
    Cyto = Cell
    Pathogen = Disease causing organism

1. Cell Types
    A. Two Basic Cell Types
        1. The cells of a prokaryotic organisms (prokaryotes) are the simplest types of cells,
           they don't have a nucleus to hold their DNA, and don't have any type of complex inner structures, called organelles.
	   Bacteria are among the simplest of organisms and have a prokaryotic cell.
        2. The cells of eukaryotic organisms (eukaryotes) are more complex. These cells have a nucleus that holds the DNA,
           as well as having numerous parts inside the cell to carry out various functions (organelles).
           All plants and animals have these more complex eukaryotic cells.
    B. Animal vs. Plants Cells
	1. Animal cells are generally round in shape and have an outer cell membrane to hold the cell together.
	2. Plant cells are generally square in shape and, in addition to the cell membrane, have a rigid cell wall to give the cell shape and strength.
	   Also, the plant cells have chloroplasts, the organelle that allows them to photosynthesize.

2. Cell Function
    A. Cell Theory
	1. Every living thing is made of cells, which are the smallest units of life. All cells come from preexisting cells.
	2. Cells are small due to the limits of diffusion. If cells were too large, all of the chemicals that must move in and out of the cell couldn't do so fast enough.
    B. Organelles
	1. Organelles are intracellular structures and carry out specific functions.
	2. The cytoplasm is a jelly-like liquid that holds the organelles. {cyto = cell}
	3. The nucleus contains the cell's DNA. It is surrounded by a nuclear membrane.
	4. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis in the cell.
	5. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) looks like a thin, folded ribbon that connects the nucleus to the plasma membrane. Its functions include making molecules that are used to construct
	   other organelles and separating newly made molecules into those that stay in the cell and those that don't.
	   There are 2 types.
		Rough ER is studded with ribosomes, while smooth ER is not.
		The smooth ER makes fatty acids and steroids and also functions to detoxify harmful substances in the liver.
	6. The Golgi complex looks like a stack of flattened sacs. Its function is to process and package proteins that have been made in the cell.
	7. Mitochondria are where ATP synthesis occurs. They are sometimes called the powerhouse of the cell.
	8. Lysosomes(little stomachs) are the sites of intracellular digestion, helping to digest worn-out cell parts and pathogens.
    C. The Cytoskeleton
	1. The cytoskeleton gives the cell shape, and in some cases allows for movement.
	2. The cytoskeleton is made of micro-filaments, intermediate filaments, and micro-tubules.

Chapter 5 - Call Membrane Structure & Function

1. Plasma Membrane
    A. Structure & Function
	1. The plasma membrane is made of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Cholesterol is one of the components.
	2. The membrane is made of 2 layers; this is why the structure is often referred to as a phospholipid bilayer.
	3. The phospholipid molecules that make up the membrane have 2 parts: a hydrophilic (water-loving) head that faces
	   the watery environment of the inside and outside of the cell, and a hydrophobic (water-hating) tail that faces inward.
	4. The membrane is selectively permeable. This means that is is able to let in good substances, such as nutrients and oxygen.
	   And keep out bad substances, such as wastes and toxins.
	5. The membrane also functions in communication between cells using gap junctions, can help to hold cells together via junctions called desmosomes.
	   And make cells leak-proof using tight junctions.
    B. Membrane Proteins
	1. There are a variety of proteins in the membrane. They may be either integral (completely within the membrane itself) or peripheral (stuck to the outside).
	2. Membrane proteins function to help move chemicals back and forth through the membrane. They also function as receptors for chemicals that bind to the membrane
	   or as enzymes that help to speed up chemical reactions.

2. Types of Cellular Transport
    A. Diffusion
	1. Diffusion is the movement of particles down a concentration gradient, from where there are more of them to where there are less of them, until equilibrium is reached.
	2. Diffusion is what happens when you take the lid off a bottle of something and the smell diffuses through the area.
	3. Diffusion just happens; no input of energy is required.
	4. Facilitated diffusion occurs when a protein molecule helps the diffusion process along.
    B. Osmosis
	1. Osmosis is the diffusion of water down a concentration gradient until equilibrium is reached.
	   It also just happens; no energy input is required.
	2. There are 3 possible osmotic conditions.
	   A) An isomotic condition occurs when there is no net movement of water.
	      A cell placed in an isomotic solution will stay the same shape and size. This means that the concentration
	      of particles in the solution is the same as the concentration of particles inside the cell.
	   B) A hypertonic condition occurs when there are more particles outside the cell than inside the cell.
	      This causes water to leave the cell, causing it to shrink.
	   C) A hypotonic condition occurs when there are more particles inside the cell, that there are in the solution.
	      This causes water to rush into the cell, swelling (or even bursting) it.
    C. Energy Requiring Transports
	1. Some processes require the input of energy in order to occur.
	2. Active transport moves particles against their concentration gradient (uphill).
	3. Endocytosis is the movement of substances into a cell (like nutrients).
	4. Exocytosis is the movement of substances out of a cell (like wastes).

Chapter 6 - Energy Flow in the Life of a Cell

1. Energy
    A. Definitions
	1. Energy is the capacity to do work
	2. "Work" may be making molecules, generating motion or generating heat.
	3. Potential energy is stored energy, like the stored energy of water behind a dam
	   or the stored electricity in a battery.
	4. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, like water flowing over a dam.
    B. The Laws of Thermodynamics
	1. The First Law says that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
	2. The Second Law says that whenever energy is concerted from one form to another, the amount of useful energy decreases.
	   The "wasted" energy is usually given off as heat. Internal combustion engines are generally not very efficient, only
	   converting about 20% of the energy in fuel to moving the vehicle; the rest of the energy is wasted as heat.
	3. Living systems are generally more efficient; the human body converts about 38% of the energy in food we eat into useful activities;
	   the rest is given off as heat.
    C. Entropy
	1. Processes that proceed spontaneously lead to increasing disorder. Does this conflict with the general idea of evolution
	   that has simple organisms organizing into more complex organisms?
	2. Energy must be put in to reverse entropy. A box of random parts will not organize itself into something more complex without the input
	   of energy.

2. Energy and Chemical Reactions
    A. Definitions
	1. A chemical reaction is the conversion of one set of chemicals to another.
	2. The reactants are the beginning chemicals, and the products are the ending chemicals.
	3. Endergonic reactions require the input of energy in order to occur.
	   Example:
		ADP + P + energy == ATP
	4. Exergonic reactions release energy.
	   Example:
		ATP breaks down to ADP + P + energy
	5. Activation energy is the initial push of energy required to get a reaction going.
	6. Coupled reactions are when an exergonic reaction provides the energy to drive an endergonic reaction.
	   This situation occurs in photosynthesis -- the sun's energy drives sugar-making reactions in plants.

3. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)
    A. Energy Carrier Molecules (ECM)
	1. ATP is the most common ECM
	2. ATP is made of adenosine, a sugar called ribose, and 3 phosphate molecules
	3. The energy to make ATP comes from glucose.
	4. The breaking of the phosphate bond releases energy.
    B. Electron Carriers (EC)
	1. There are other molecules that transport energy within a cell.
	2. These molecules, like NAD+ and FAD, donate their electrons and the energy in them to drive endergonic reactions.

4. Metabolic Reactions
    A. Definitions
	1. Metabolism is the sum of all the different chemical reactions taking place in an organism.
	2. Homeostatis is the maintaining of a steady state in an organism. Some parameters that must be maintained in
	   equilibrium are blood pressure, heart rate, water balance, pH, body temperature, and glucose levels. These are
	   all monitored and controlled by the brain. Corrective action is taken to keep factors in their correct ranges.
	   For example, if your blood pressure becomes too thick because you are becoming dehydrated, your brain senses this
	   and gives you the sensation of thirst, which drives you to drink water to rehydrate yourself and return your blood
	   to the normal level of hydration.
    B. Enzymes
	1. Enzymes are specialized protein molecules that catalyze (speed up) chemical reactions.
	2. The molecules they affect are called substrates.
	3. They speed up reactions without being destroyed or forming byproducts.
	4. There are more than 2,000 known enzymes.
	5. An enzyme's functionality depends on its shape. If this shape is changed by extremes
	   of temperature or pH, it may be damaged or destroyed. This is called denaturation.
	   Most enzymes have a three dimensional shape; if this shape is damaged, the enzyme will not
	   function, just as a bent key will no longer fit in the lock.
	6. Most biological reactions occur best at normal body temperature and pH levels.

Chapter 7 - Photosynthesis

1. Photosynthesis
    A. The Reaction
	1. Photosynthesis is the conversion of the sun's energy into chemical energy by plants.
	   (A few other organisms can also photosynthesize, like some bacteria).
	2. The reactants are carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) and the products are
	   glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). Notice that carbon dioxide is a critical input to
	   the reaction.
	   Example:
		6(CO2)+6(H2O) -> C6H12O6 + 6(O2)
    B. The Location
	1. Photosynthesis takes place in leaves (or other green parts, like stems). Leaves are
	   generally thin and easily penetrated by light. Plant that aren't green still have chlorophyll
	   and photosynthesize; they have other pigments that mask the presence of the green chlorophyll.
	2. Plants have a large surface area for photosynthesis.
	3. Plants have pores in their leave call stomata that open and close to let O2 and CO2 in and out,
	   as well as to let water out. In land plants, the stomata tend to be concentrated on the lower
	   surface of the leaf; this helps to reduce water loss. In water plants, the stomata are found
	   all over the left, since water loss isn't a concern.
	4. Photosynthesis happens in organelles called chloroplasts, which contain the green pigment chlorophyll.
	5. The semi-fluid substance inside leaves is called stroma, and it holds structures called thylakoids that look
	   like disc-shaped flatted sacs. It's in these thylakoids that light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur.
    C. Light and Dark Reactions
	1. The light-dependent reactions capture sunlight and convert it into ATP and a molecule called NADPH.
	   These reactions consume water and release O2. These reactions take place in the thylakoids in locations
	   called photosystems. Each of the photosystems contains proteins, chlorophyll and other pigments.
	2. The light-independent (dark) reactions use the ATP and NADPH to make glucose, using CO2 in the process.
	   The chemicals from these reactions are cycled back into the light reactions; since the process occurs in a cycle,
	   it's called the C3 or Calvin Cycle.

2. Water Conservation and Photosynthesis
    A. Carbon Dioxide
	1. CO2 is the required input for photosynthesis
	2. If the water supply to the plant is inadequate, the stomata leaves stay open, letting in CO2. This "normal"
	   pathway to photosynthesize is called the C3 pathway.
	3. If the plant is dry, the stomata close to save water. This prevents CO2 from entering, which slows or stops photosynthesis.
	4. This triggers a process called photorespiration, which is a wasteful process that prevents the Calvin Cycle
	   from producing glucose, essentially shutting down photosynthesis.
    B. Alternate Pathways
	1. Some plants have developed alternate pathways to reduce photosrespiration, allowing them to
	   produce glucose even during hot, dry conditions.
	2. The two pathways are:
		A) Some plants, called C4 plants, use a separate series of reactions to capture carbon in one part of the leaf
	 	   and move it to another part of the leaf where it can enter the Calvin Cycle. Crabgrass, corn and sugarcane
		   are examples of C4 plants.
		B) Some plants, go a step further and in addition to using this C4 pathway also keep their stomata closed
		   during the day to conserve water, this is called CAM. The cacti are CAM plants.

Chapter 8 - Harvesting Energy: Glycolysis & Cellular Respiration

1. Cellular Respiration
    A. Energy and Cell Work
	1. Cells need energy to make and transport molecules, grow, repair, and divide.
	2. Energy is stored in the bonds of molecules like fats & carbohydrates.
	   The energy in these bonds must be transferred to the bonds of energy carrier molecules
	   like ATP.
	3. Cells break down glucose for energy. Brain cells can only use glucose for energy--nothing else!
	4. Photosynthesis is the ultimate source of energy. All organisms ultimately rely on plants.
	5. Photosynthesis and glucose metabolism are complementary processes.
		6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2 is Photosynthesis
		C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy is Cellular Respiration
    B. The Steps of Glucose Metabolism
	1. Glycolysis
		A) Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell
		B) One molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate
		C) The process doesn't need oxygen to proceed (it is anaerobic)
		D) There is a net production of two molecules of ATP per glucose
	2. The Citric Acid (Krebs) Cycle
		A) The process requires oxygen (is aerobic)
		B) The process occurs in the mitochondria
		C) In a series of steps, the pyruvate from glycolysis is broken down
		   to CO2 and H2O.
		D) There is a net production of 2 molecules of ATP.
		E) The electron carrier molecules NADH and FADH2 are also produced.
	3. The Electron Transport Chain
		A) This process occurs in the mitochondria.
		B) This process is also aerobic
		C) The process occurs in a series of steps that take electrons from NADH and
		   FADH2 and move them down a "chain" of molecules until they ultimately reach
  		   O2, which is the final electron acceptor. This is why we must have a
		   constant supply of O2; without it, this process stops immediately.
		D) Most of the cell's energy is produced during this process; up to 34
		   molecules of ATP per glucose molecule.

2. Fermentation
    A. Fermentation is Anaerobic
	1. Fermentation provides a mechanism for organisms(like some bacteria) to live in
	   environments with no oxygen.
	2. These types of environments are often found beneath bodies of water like lakes
	   and oceans and in marshes, swamps, and bogs.
    B. Mechanisms of Action
	1. Fermentation only involves Glycolysis, no Krebs cycle or ETC can occur.
	2. The pyruvate produced by glycolysis acts as an electron acceptor for NADH.
	   The pyruvate is converted to either ethanol or lactate (depending on the organism
	   that is undergoing fermentation).
	3. The NADH is converted back to a molecule called NAD+, which keeps the glycolysis
	   and ATP production going.
    C. Ethanol or Lactate Production
	1. Alcoholic fermentation by yeasts produces ethanol and CO2 as byproducts. This
	   type of fermentation by yeasts produces the beer and wine, as well as bread products.
	   The CO2 produces the bubbles in beer and Champagne. In bread products, the CO2 produced
	   by yeast causes the bread to rise. The alcohol evaporates away during the cooking process
	   The spaces left behind in the bread represent where the carbon dioxide bubbles were.
	2. Some organisms, like bacteria, produce lactate as they are undergoing fermentation.
	   This process produces foods like sauerkraut, dill pickles, cheeses, and yogurt.
	   Different species of bacteria produce the different flavors of cheeses.
	3. Prior to refrigeration, these processes allowed food to be preserved for long
	   period of time. Prior to modern sanitation, alcoholic beverages were often the
	   only safe fluid to drink, as the water was often contaminated with pathogens.
